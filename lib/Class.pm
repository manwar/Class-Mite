=head1 NAME

Class - Lightweight Perl object system with parent-first BUILD and method copying

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.04

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Class;

    # Simple class with attributes and BUILD
    package Person;
    use Class;

    sub BUILD {
        my ($self, $attrs) = @_;
        $self->{full_name} = $attrs->{first} . ' ' . $attrs->{last};
    }

    package Employee;
    use Class;
    extends 'Person';

    sub BUILD {
        my ($self, $attrs) = @_;
        $self->{employee_id} = $attrs->{id};
    }

    # Create an object
    my $emp = Employee->new(first => 'John', last => 'Doe', id => 123);

    print $emp->{full_name};   # John Doe
    print $emp->{employee_id}; # 123

    # Using roles if Role.pm is available
    package Manager;
    use Class;
    with 'SomeRole';
    my $mgr = Manager->new();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Class provides a lightweight Perl object system with:

=over 4

=item * Parent-first constructor building via C<BUILD> methods.

=item * Simple inheritance via C<extends> with method copying.

=item * Optional role consumption via C<with> and C<does> (if C<Role> module is available).

=item * Automatic caching of BUILD order for efficient object creation.

=item * Optimized method copying for better performance.

=back

This module includes performance optimizations such as cached BUILD method resolution,
efficient parent class loading, and optimized method copying with caching.

=cut

=head1 BUILD METHODS

Classes can define a C<BUILD> method:

    sub BUILD {
        my ($self, $attrs) = @_;
        # initialize object
    }

All BUILD methods in the inheritance chain are called in parent-first order during C<new>. The order is determined by depth-first traversal, ensuring that parent classes are always initialized before their children.

For diamond inheritance patterns:

    A
   / \
  B   C
   \ /
    D

BUILD methods are called in the order: A, B, C, D (true parent-first order)

=head1 METHOD COPYING

This system copies public methods from parent classes to child classes. This design enables:

=over 4

=item * Direct method access in child symbol tables

=item * Proper functioning of object cloning

=item * Better performance for frequently called methods

=item * Compatibility with code that expects direct method access

=back

The following methods are NOT copied:

=over 4

=item * Special methods (BUILD, new, extends, with, does, import, AUTOLOAD, DESTROY)

=item * Private methods (starting with underscore)

=item * Package metadata (ISA, VERSION, EXPORT, etc.)

=back

=head1 ROLES

If a C<Role> module is available, you can consume roles via:

    with 'RoleName';
    does 'RoleName';

This provides role-based composition for shared behavior. The Role module must be installed separately.

=head1 PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS

This version includes significant performance improvements:

=over 4

=item * Cached BUILD method resolution using depth-first parent-first order

=item * Precomputed skip patterns for fast method filtering

=item * Method copying cache to avoid duplicate operations

=item * Efficient parent class loading with minimal overhead

=item * Optimized symbol table scanning

=back

=head1 CACHING

Class uses internal caches to optimize performance:

=over 4

=item * C<%BUILD_METHODS_CACHE> - caches linearized parent-first build order

=item * C<%METHOD_COPY_CACHE> - tracks which parent-child pairs have had methods copied

=back

Caches are automatically updated when inheritance changes via C<extends>.

=head1 ERROR HANDLING

=over 4

=item * Recursive inheritance is detected and throws an exception.

=item * Failure to load a parent class is non-fatal (parent might be defined inline).

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

=head2 Basic Inheritance with Method Copying

    package Animal;
    use Class;
    sub speak { "animal sound" }
    sub eat   { "eating" }

    package Dog;
    use Class;
    extends 'Animal';
    sub speak { "woof" }  # Overrides parent method

    my $dog = Dog->new;
    print $dog->speak;  # "woof" (from Dog)
    print $dog->eat;    # "eating" (copied from Animal)

    # Method is copied to Dog's symbol table
    no strict 'refs';
    print defined &Dog::eat ? "copied" : "not copied";  # "copied"

=head2 Diamond Inheritance

    package A;
    use Class;
    sub BUILD { print "A BUILD\n" }

    package B;
    use Class;
    extends 'A';
    sub BUILD { print "B BUILD\n" }

    package C;
    use Class;
    extends 'A';
    sub BUILD { print "C BUILD\n" }

    package D;
    use Class;
    extends 'B', 'C';
    sub BUILD { print "D BUILD\n" }

    my $d = D->new;
    # Output: A BUILD, B BUILD, C BUILD, D BUILD

=head2 Object Cloning with Method Copying

    package Base;
    use Class;
    sub clone_method { "works" }

    package Child;
    use Class;
    extends 'Base';

    my $original = Child->new;
    my $cloned = bless { %$original }, ref($original);

    # Works because methods are copied to Child
    print $cloned->clone_method;  # "works"

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

    my $obj = Class->new(%attributes);

Constructs a new object of the class, calling all C<BUILD> methods from parent classes in parent-first order. All attributes are passed to C<BUILD> as a hashref.

The constructor uses cached BUILD method references for optimal performance, especially in deep inheritance hierarchies.

=cut

=head2 _compute_build_methods

    my $build_methods = _compute_build_methods($class);

Internal method that computes the BUILD methods in parent-first order using depth-first traversal.

This ensures BUILD methods are called from the root parent down to the child class, which is essential for proper initialization in inheritance hierarchies.

=cut

=head2 _depth_first_traverse

    _depth_first_traverse($class, \@order, \%visited);

Internal recursive method that performs depth-first traversal of the inheritance hierarchy.

This method ensures that parent classes are always processed before their children, which is crucial for correct BUILD method ordering.

=cut

=head2 extends

    extends 'ParentClass';
    extends 'Parent1', 'Parent2';

Adds one or more parent classes to the calling class. This method:

=over 4

=item * Automatically loads parent classes if not already loaded

=item * Prevents recursive inheritance

=item * Copies public methods from parents to children

=item * Maintains inheritance via C<@ISA>

=item * Clears relevant caches to ensure consistency

=back

Method copying is performed to ensure that inherited methods are directly available in the child class's symbol table, which enables features like object cloning to work correctly.

=cut

=head2 _copy_public_methods

    _copy_public_methods($child_class, $parent_class);

Internal method that copies public methods from parent to child class. This method:

=over 4

=item * Skips special methods (BUILD, new, extends, etc.)

=item * Skips private methods (starting with underscore)

=item * Uses caching to avoid duplicate copying

=item * Only copies methods not already defined in child

=back

This optimized implementation uses precomputed skip patterns and caching for better performance.

=cut

=head2 _delete_build_cache

    _delete_build_cache($class);

Internal method that clears the BUILD methods cache for a class and all classes that inherit from it.

This ensures cache consistency when inheritance relationships change. Also clears method copy caches for affected classes.

=cut

=head2 _inherits_from

    _inherits_from($class, $parent);

Internal recursive method that checks if a class inherits from another class, either directly or indirectly.

Returns true if C<$class> inherits from C<$parent>, false otherwise.

=cut

=head1 IMPORT

    use Class;
    use Class 'extends' => 'Parent';

When imported, Class automatically installs the following functions into the caller's namespace:

=over 4

=item * C<new> - constructor

=item * C<extends> - inheritance helper

=item * C<with> and C<does> - if Role.pm is available

=back

Optionally, you can specify C<extends> in the import statement to immediately set a parent class:

    use Class 'extends' => 'Parent';

The import method also enables L<strict> and L<warnings> in the calling package.
