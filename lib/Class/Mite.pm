=head1 NAME

Class::Mite - A minimal, integrated Class and Role system for Perl

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.04

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This distribution provides two separate, complementary modules:

=over 4

=item * L<Role> - For defining and consuming methods with requirements and conflict resolution.

=item * L<Class> - A base class providing a default constructor (C<new>) with a post-construction hook (C<BUILD>).

=back

You use them together like this:

    package Loggable;

    use Role;
    requires qw/id name/;

    sub log {
        my ($self) = @_;
        return "[" . $self->id . "]: " . $self->name;
    }

    package User;

    use Class;
    with qw/Loggable/;

    sub id   { shift->{id}   }
    sub name { shift->{name} }

    package main;

    my $user = User->new(id => 1, name => 'Alice');
    print $user->log, "\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Class::Mite> bundles a very minimal, high-speed approach to object-oriented
programming in Perl. It borrows best practices from systems like L<Moo> and L<Role::Tiny>
while keeping external dependencies and boilerplate code to an absolute nothing.

=head1 MODULES IN THIS DISTRIBUTION

=over 4

=item * L<Role>

The core role composition engine. Provides C<requires>, C<excludes>, C<with>,
and method conflict detection.

=item * L<Class>

The base class provider. Provides a default, hash-based C<new> constructor that
automatically calls a user-defined C<BUILD> method if one is present. It also
ensures the C<with> function from L<Role> is available to simplify consumption
syntax.
